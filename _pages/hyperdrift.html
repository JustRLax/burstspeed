          <p>Hyper Drift Shootout (HDS) is an abridged tandem competition series hosted by ClubFR in the 2019 season. There will be a total of 9 HDS events consisting of 8 seeding events and 1 championship event. The 8 seeding events will be used to select the top 8 drivers who will then battle in the final championship event.</p>
          <h3>When?</h3>
          <p>The 8 seeding events will take place at regular drift events held at USAIR Motorsports. Each competition is limited to 8 drivers and will take place outside of regular drift event time (after the event, or during the lunch hour). This will prevent the competition from interfering with the regularly scheduled drift event.</p>
          <h3>Who?</h3>
          <p>Any driver whom is signed up for regular registration at a Drift Day featuring a seeding event. Drivers may not sign up for the competition without being signed up for the event occurring that day.</p>
          <p>There is a maximum amount of 8 drivers per seeding event. Any driver that has come in 1st place at a previous seeding event cannot sign up for another seeding event. Drivers interested in competing must inform ClubFR Staff prior to 10AM on the event day.</p>
          <p>In the event that we have more than 8 drivers interested in competing, drivers who have competed in previous rounds will not be chosen to drive. If there are still more than 8, drivers will be picked at random.</p>
          <p>Championship event drivers will be all 8 winners from the 8 seeded events. If one of the winners is unable to attend the final round a 2nd place driver from the previous rounds may replace said driver. If a 2nd place driver is unable to attend, that position in the 8 will be forfeited.</p>

            <h3>Tech</h3>
            <p>Please review the ClubFR <a href="http://www.clubfr.net/tech-rules">Tech Rules</a>. All standard drift day rules apply including the following additional rules: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>All vehicles must have a fire extinguisher within reach of the driver and securely mounted </li>
              <li>Only one pair of tires may be used during the entire top 8 competition (tires may be changed after practice)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Layout</h3>
            <p>The layout for each seeding event will be a current layout being used at the drift day occurring that day. The regular event day should be used for practice if you are competing.</p>
            <p>The final championship event will feature a layout not used during normal drift days. Drivers will be given a short time period to practice.</p>
            <h3>Qualification</h3>
            <p>Only 8 drivers will be selected via "qualifying" which takes place during the normal morning session. The 8 drivers selected will be seeded in a traditional top 8 bracket. Each driver will receive a number 1 through 8.</p>

          <div class="col">
            <h3>Top 8</h3>
            <p>After the top 8 bracket has been decided, drivers will directly go into competition. There will be no practice runs. The layout will be the same as the layout of the regular drift day occurring that day (see “Layout” section for more details). Drivers with the lower number will lead first.</p>
            <p>The battles will go as follows, each winner will move on to the top 4:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Driver #1 (leading) vs Driver #8 (chase) </li>
              <li>Driver #2 (leading) vs Driver #7 (chase) </li>
              <li>Driver #3 (leading) vs Driver #6 (chase) </li>
              <li>Driver #4 (leading) vs Driver #5 (chase)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Top 4</h3>
            <p>The 4 winners from top 8 will battle head to head. The lowest number will lead first.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Winner of #1 v #8 vs Winner of #4 v #5 </li>
              <li>Winner of #2 v #7 vs Winner of #3 v #6</li>
            </ul>
          </div> <!-- / .col -->
          <div class="col">
            <h3>Top 2</h3>
            <p>Winners from the top 4 will battle head to head. The lowest number will lead first. For the seeding rounds, there will be no battle for 3rd place. For the 9th championship event, a battle for 3rd place between the 3rd and 4th place will take place before the battle for 1st.</p>
            <h3>Final Event</h3>
            <p>The 8 winners of each seeding event will be invited to the final championship event (date TBD). There will be no qualifying for this event either. The order will be determined by the event won. For example, the winner of the first event will be seeded as Driver #1, the second event will be Driver #2, etc. These numbers will be used to fill the bracket as mentioned in the “Format” section above.</p>
            <p>The final event will feature a new layout, drivers will be given a short amount of time to practice prior to the competition.</p>
